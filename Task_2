ASSUMPTION:
-> Some points in the grid network cannot be accessed, as there are no path to those co-ordinates.
-> The network grid can be represented as two-dimensional grid of integers, where each integer represents one cell.
-> The electricity must flow from top-left corner of the area, which is always accessible, and can move one cell up,
   down, left or right at a time.
-> The network must navigate around the areas without path and cannot leave the area.
-> The accesible areas represented as 1, areas without the path are represented by 0 and the final destination is represented by 9.

INPUT
The input to the function/method consists of three arguments:
numRows, an integerrepresenting the number of rows.
numColumns, an integer representing the number of columns.
area, representing the two-dimensional grid of integers.

OUTPUT:
return an integer representing the total distance traversed by the electricity to deliver else retuen -1.

CONSTRAINTS
1 <= numRows, numColumns <= 1000

Example
input:: numRows =3, numColumns=3, 
area = [[1,0,0]
        [1,0,0]
        [1,9,1]]
        
output:: 3

Explanation
staring from top-left corner, the current trarversed the cell (0,0)->(1,0)->(2,0)-> (2,1).
The current traversed the total of distance 3 to deliver to final destination.
so the output is 3.
